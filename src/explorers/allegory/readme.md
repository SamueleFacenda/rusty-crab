Allegory is an explorer developed for unitn AP2025.

Allegory aims at collecting enough resources to leave the solar system and retire as soon as possible.

## Algorithm

It achieves its task in three steps:

1. Exploration: first, all planets are mapped and the useful information are collected
2. Collection: using the collected information, the required resources are collected
3. Crafting: the complex resources are created on the available planets

## Finale

If all resources are collected, the rover completes it task and retires.

If instead all planets producing a required resource or crafting explode, the explorer fails its mission.

## Task

The default task is to get two pet dolphins with some spare water (3),
as well as rocket fuel (4 hydrogen, 2 oxygen).
